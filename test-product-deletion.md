# Product Deletion Fix - Test Documentation

## Issue Fixed
The product ejection/deletion functionality was not working correctly. When a product was "deleted", it would still appear in the product list because:

1. The deletion was only a mock implementation (not actually deleting from database)
2. The product list refresh would fetch all products including the supposedly deleted ones

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Real Delete Functionality
- Created `FormService.deleteProduct()` method in `lib/services/formService.ts`
- Implements both hard delete and soft delete based on product dependencies
- Checks for related data (sales, lots, transfers) before deletion
- If related data exists: marks product as `inactive` (soft delete)
- If no related data: performs actual deletion from database

### 2. Updated Product Fetching
- Modified `FormService.getProducts()` to exclude products with `product_status = 'inactive'`
- Modified `FormService.getExistingProducts()` to exclude inactive products
- Updated `app/transfer.tsx` product fetching to exclude inactive products

### 3. Updated Product Deletion UI
- Modified `app/products.tsx` to use the real delete function instead of mock
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic refresh of product list after successful deletion

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: Delete Product with No Dependencies
1. Go to Products page
2. Find a product that has no sales, lots, or transfers
3. Click delete button
4. Confirm deletion
5. **Expected Result**: Product should be completely removed from the list

### Test Case 2: Delete Product with Dependencies
1. Go to Products page
2. Find a product that has sales history or stock lots
3. Click delete button
4. Confirm deletion
5. **Expected Result**: Product should disappear from the list (soft deleted - marked as inactive)

### Test Case 3: Verify Product List Refresh
1. Before deletion: Note the total number of products
2. Delete a product
3. **Expected Result**: Product list should automatically refresh and show updated count

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/formService.ts`
   - Added `deleteProduct()` method
   - Updated `getProducts()` to exclude inactive products
   - Updated `getExistingProducts()` to exclude inactive products

2. `app/products.tsx`
   - Updated delete handler to use real delete function
   - Improved error handling

3. `app/transfer.tsx`
   - Updated product fetching to exclude inactive products

## Technical Details

### Soft Delete vs Hard Delete
- **Soft Delete**: Product marked as `inactive`, preserves data integrity
- **Hard Delete**: Product completely removed from database
- Decision based on existence of related records (sales, lots, transfers)

### Database Consistency
- All product fetching queries now filter out inactive products
- Maintains referential integrity for historical data
- Prevents orphaned records in related tables

## Benefits
1. ✅ Products are actually removed from the list when deleted
2. ✅ Data integrity is preserved for products with transaction history
3. ✅ Consistent behavior across all product listing components
4. ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
5. ✅ Automatic UI refresh after deletion
