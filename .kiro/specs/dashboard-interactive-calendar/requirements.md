# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an interactive mini calendar feature in the Dashboard. When users click on the calendar icon in the dashboard, a mini calendar will appear that allows them to navigate through dates, view events, and interact with calendar-specific data.

4. WHEN the user clicks outside the mini calendar THEN the system SHALL close the calendar

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to navigate between months in the mini calendar, so that I can view past and future dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a date THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected date

3. WHEN a date is selected THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback of the selection
4. WHEN the user selects a different date THEN the system SHALL update the previous selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see visual indicators for dates with important events or data, so that I can quickly identify significant dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dates have associated events or data THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators (dots, badges, or highlights)
2. WHEN hovering over dates with indicators THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with event information
3. WHEN dates have different types of events THEN the system SHALL use different colors or indicators
4. WHEN no events exist for a date THEN the system SHALL display the date normally

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the mini calendar to be responsive and work well on mobile devices, so that I can use it effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mini calendar is displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the size and layout for touch interaction
2. WHEN using touch gestures THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to taps and swipes
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain calendar functionality
4. WHEN the calendar is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper spacing for touch targets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the mini calendar to integrate seamlessly with the existing dashboard theme, so that it maintains visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mini calendar is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the current theme colors and styling
2. WHEN the theme is changed (light/dark mode) THEN the system SHALL update the calendar appearance accordingly
3. WHEN displaying the calendar THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent typography and spacing with the dashboard
